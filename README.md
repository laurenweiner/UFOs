# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to document reported UFO sightings and create an interactive html page for users to be able to easily filter the results by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

Unfortunatley, I was not able to configure my code to allow the filter to work. I believe that problem is occuring in step 9, however I do not know how to fix it.

## Summary

One drawback of the design is that you cannot save your search criteria. Recomendations for further development include: 1) allow users to save their search critera so they may easily reapply the filters in the future, and 2) allow users to set up alert emails for when new data is added within their search criteria.
